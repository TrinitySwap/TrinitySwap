<mark style="color:green;">**NO TEAM TOKENS**</mark> - The TSP Team will NOT hold any tokens. The only tokens owned by the TRINITYSwap Treasury will be collected via accumulating trading fees. We are committed to the longevity of the project and thus the TSE team cannot dump on you.\ <mark style="color:green;">****</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">****</mark><mark style="color:green;">**NO EXTRA MINT OR HIDDEN TOKENS**</mark> - The TSP smart contract has NO ability to mint extra tokens nor can the supply be manually increased or used in an artificial way to change the initial supply by awarding ourselves free tokens. The initial supply is '' tokens only (please see the breakdown above).\
\
<mark style="color:green;">**NO RUG PULL**</mark> - Liquidity will be locked for '' days via trusted Unicrypt.Network which cannot be touched or released early. (This means that you as a token holder will ALWAYS have the freedom to buy/sell whenever you like without restrictions or complications - your tokens that you buy are yours and remain in your wallet always and are never 'locked').

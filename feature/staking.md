**TRINITYSwap - Staking**
{% endhint %}

<mark style="background-color:purple;">**TRINITYSwap**</mark> provides a decentralized financial asset which rewards users with a sustainable fixed compound interest model through use of its unique SAP protocol.

The $Trinity Auto-Staking Protocol (SAP for short) is a new financial protocol that makes staking easier, more efficient and awards $Trinity token holders the highest stable returns in crypto.

The SAP uses a complex set of factors to support its price and the rebase rewards. It includes the <mark style="background-color:purple;">**TRINITYSwap**</mark> Insurance Fund (TIF) which serves as an insurance fund to achieve price stability and long-term sustainability of the TRINITYSwap  by maintaining a consistent 0.02% rebase rate paid to all $Trinity token holders every 15 minutes.

The $Trinity development team has coordinated all of these elements together so they work seamlessly behind the scenes. The result is a simple and elegant staking and rewards system for $Trinity holders.&#x20;

* The SAP Auto-Stake feature is a simple yet cutting-edge function called Buy-Hold-Earn, that provides the ultimate ease of use for $Trinity holders.
* **Buy-Hold-Earn** - By simply buying and holding $Trinity token in your wallet, you earn Yiel Farming rewards as interest payments directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase **every 15 minutes**.
* TRINITYSwap makes it possible for token distribution to be paid directly proportional to the Yiel Farming rewards, worth 0.02% every 15-minute epoch period of the total amount of $Trinity tokens held in your wallet.&#x20;

# ♻ Staking

{% hint style="success" %}
**TRINITYSwap - Staking**
{% endhint %}

<mark style="background-color:purple;">**TRINITYSwap**</mark> provides a decentralized financial asset which rewards users with a sustainable fixed compound interest model through use of its unique SAP protocol.

The TSP Auto-Staking Protocol (SAP for short) is a new financial protocol that makes staking easier, more efficient and awards TSP token holders the highest stable returns in crypto.

The SAP uses a complex set of factors to support its price and the rebase rewards. It includes the <mark style="background-color:purple;">**TRINITYSwap**</mark> Insurance Fund (TIF) which serves as an insurance fund to achieve price stability and long-term sustainability of the TRINITYSwap  by maintaining a consistent 0.0225% rebase rate paid to all TSP token holders every 6 minutes.

The TSP development team has coordinated all of these elements together so they work seamlessly behind the scenes. The result is a simple and elegant staking and rewards system for TSP holders.&#x20;

* The SAP Auto-Stake feature is a simple yet cutting-edge function called Buy-Hold-Earn, that provides the ultimate ease of use for TSP holders.
* **Buy-Hold-Earn** - By simply buying and holding TSP token in your wallet, you earn rebase rewards as interest payments directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase **every 6 minutes**.
* Using a Positive Rebase formula, TRINITYSwap makes it possible for token distribution to be paid directly proportional to the epoch rebase rewards, worth 0.0225 % every 6-minute epoch period of the total amount of TSP tokens held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed on each EPOCH (6-minute rebase period) to all TSP holders.
* **This means that without moving their tokens from their wallet, TSP holders receive an annual compound interest of 751,203.80% for Year 1.**
* **The interest rebase rate then reduces after the first 12 months.**

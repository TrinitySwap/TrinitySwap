**TRINITYSwap - Treasury**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

TrinitySwap Treasury plays a very important role in TrinitySwap SAP protocol. It provides three extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of TSP.

The TRINITYSwap Treasury acts as additional financial support for the TIF. This additional support can become important in case of an extreme drop in the price of the $Trinity token or an unforeseen dewan-black event. It helps to establish a minimum value for the $Trinity token.

<mark style="background-color:purple;">**TRINITYSwap**</mark> can also be used to finance new $Trinity products, services and projects that will expand and provide more value to our community, thus enabling us to leverage our marketing expansively.

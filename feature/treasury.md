**TRINITYSwap - Treasury**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

TrinitySwap Treasury plays a very important role in TrinitySwap SAP protocol. It provides three extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of $Trinity.

The TRINITYSwap Treasury acts as additional financial support for the TIF. This additional support can become important in case of an extreme drop in the price of the $Trinity token or an unforeseen dewan-black event. It helps to establish a minimum value for the $Trinity token.

<mark style="background-color:purple;">**TRINITYSwap**</mark> can also be used to finance new $Trinity products, services and projects that will expand and provide more value to our community, thus enabling us to leverage our marketing expansively.

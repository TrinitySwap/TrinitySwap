# 3âƒ£ Web3

## What is Web 3.0?&#x20;

Web 3.0 (also known as Web3) is the next generation of Internet technology that relies heavily on machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology. The term was coined by Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot and cofounder of Ethereum. While Web 2.0 focuses on user-created content hosted on centralized websites, Web 3.0 will give users more control over their online data.

## The Future and Web 3.0&#x20;

When looking at the history of the Internet, the evolution of a semantically intelligent web makes sense. Initially, data was presented to users in a static form. Later, users could interact with this data dynamically. Now, algorithms will use all this data to improve the user experience and make the web more personalized and familiar. YouTube and Netflix are two great examples that show us the power of algorithms and how they have already evolved.

## Web3 integration in TRINITYSwap

We will approach web3 with all the information from TRINITYSwap into personalized and relevant information faster through artificial intelligence (AI). With smarter search algorithms and the development of Big Data analytics, machines will be able to understand and recommend content intuitively.

**TRINITYSwap - Lottery**
{% endhint %}

On the last Thursday of every month there is a lottery drawing where our investors can participate by purchasing lottery tickets on the main TRINITYSwap website using our TSP tokens. Our lottery is fully automated, where we use chainlink servers and cannot be controlled by staff, so we can guarantee security and fairness through this means. The more investors that participate in the tournament, the bigger the prize pool. A certain percentage of the prize pool will be burnt after the end of the draw, thus making the TSP token scarcer and increasing its value.

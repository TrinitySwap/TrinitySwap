## Introduction

<mark style="background-color:purple;">**The metaverse**</mark> is a concept of a 3D online universe that combines several virtual environments. We can imagine the metaverse as a future iteration of the Internet. The metaverse will allow users to work, meet, play, and socialize in 3D environments.

The metaverse does not fully exist yet, but some platforms have similar elements. Currently, are video games and gaming that offer the closest experience to the concept of the metaverse. Developers have expanded the boundaries of games through events and by creating complex virtual economies.

Although not a prerequisite, cryptocurrencies are a great option for <mark style="background-color:purple;">**metaverses**</mark>. They allow the creation of a digital economy with different types of utility tokens and virtual collectibles (NFTs). The metaverse also benefits from the use of cryptocurrency wallets, such as Trust Wallet and MetaMask. In addition, blockchain technology can provide transparent and reliable governance systems.

## Metaverse by TRINITYSwap

We will adopt all the most innovative trends, and with it the metaverse will be part of our schedule, a totally useful concept, for meetings and even conferences. We will give the community the opportunity to connect to our $Trinity world. If in the future we work, socialize and even buy virtual items in the metaverse, we will need a secure way to prove ownership. We also need to feel secure when transferring items, goods and money through the metaverse. Finally, we also want to play a role in the decision making that happens in the metaverse, since the metaverse is supposed to be such an important part of our lives.

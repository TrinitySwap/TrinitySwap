# 🔥 Flame

{% hint style="success" %}
**TRINITYSwap - Flame**
{% endhint %}

1% of all TSP Traded are burnt in TrinitySwap Flame. The more that is traded, the more get put into the fire causing the fire pit to grow in size, larger and larger through self-fulfilling auto-compounding, reducing the circulating supply and keeping the TrinitySwap Protocol stable.

The other benefit to an everlasting burn of circulating supply is that due to the deflationary nature of it, equates to a higher value of each TSP <mark style="color:green;">****</mark> token, therefore increasing the individual value\

**TRINITYSwap - Flame**
{% endhint %}

1**%** of all TSP Traded are burnt in TrinitySwap Flame. The more that is traded, the more get put into the fire causing the fire pit to grow in size, larger and larger through self fulfilling Auto-Compounding, reducing the circulating supply and keeping theTrinitySwap  Protocol stable.

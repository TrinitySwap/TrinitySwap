# 🥰 NFT's

{% hint style="success" %}
**TRINITYSwap NFT's**
{% endhint %}

An NFT is a crypto-asset that represents a unique, collectible item via blockchain technology. For example, there may be demand for an NFT because it was created by a famous artist or composed by a world-renowned musician. It could also be a token useful in a game or sought after to complete a specific collection.

Simply put, it is not possible to counterfeit or copy a non-fungible token. By looking at the definition of fungibility, we can better understand what makes NFT special:

**Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be interchangeable with assets of the same type.**

We at TRINITYSwap will have an exclusive NFT $Trinity collection, where our investors will be able to purchase, and at the same time, with our NFTs, have access to the events in our metaverse world.

# ðŸ¥° NFT's

{% hint style="success" %}
**TRINITYSwap NFT's**
{% endhint %}

An NFT is a crypto-asset that represents a unique, collectible item via blockchain technology. For example, there may be demand for an NFT because it was created by a famous artist or composed by a world-renowned musician. It could also be a token useful in a game or sought after to complete a specific collection.

Simply put, it is not possible to counterfeit or copy a non-fungible token. By looking at the definition of fungibility, we can better understand what makes NFT special:

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be interchangeable with assets of the same type.**

We at TRINITYSwap will have an exclusive NFT TSP collection, where our investors will be able to purchase, and at the same time, with our NFTs, have access to the events in our metaverse world
